## Running site in development mode

To run the site in development mode you need to have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) v12.x or above.

After cloning the repositories, you can run the `yarn install` or `npm install` from the `knative-tutorial` repository to install needed nodejs packages.

Start the development site using `gulp -s $PWD` that should make the a local development site available at <http://localhost:3000>.

Making any changes to your local repositories above cloned earlier, will be automatically built and the development site gets reloaded automatically.
