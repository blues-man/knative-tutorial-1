== Running from CodeReady Workspaces

Setup for the tutorial is relatively simple.

First we need to first clone the tutorial sources and set the `TUTORIAL_HOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the tutorial.

From within a CodeReady Workspace terminal, run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT
git clone -b {branch} {repo-base}
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/knative-tutorial"
----

Next, let's create a project to run our tutorial within.  Make sure you have logged into OpenShift by running this command (and making sure your user is returned):

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc whoami
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
%USER%
----

and then run the following command within the terminal

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc new-project %USER%-knativetutorial
----

== Running Multiple Terminals

You can open multiple terminals and then dock them to different parts of the CodeReady Workspace window so that you can see two terminals at once (for instance if you were running `stern` in one and issuing commands from the other):

== Visualizing These Exercises

For all exercises in this section, you can get a visualization of what is happening by opening the 
Topology View of the `%USER%-knativetutorial` project.

To open this, *copy and paste* this link into your browser:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
https://console-openshift-console.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/%USER%-knativetutorial
----

For example, using this whilst in the xref:eventing:eventing-src-to-sink.adoc#eventing-create-event-source[Knative Eventing Section] might yield this:
