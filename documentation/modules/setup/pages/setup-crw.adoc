== Running from CodeReady Workspaces

Setup for the tutorial is relatively simple.

First we need to first clone the tutorial sources and set the `TUTORIAL_HOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the tutorial.

From within a CodeReady Workspace terminal, run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT
git clone -b {branch} {repo-base}
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/knative-tutorial"
----

Next, let's create a project to run our tutorial within.  Make sure you have logged into OpenShift by running this command (and making sure your user is returned):

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc whoami
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
%USER%
----

and then run the following command within the terminal

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc new-project %USER%-knativetutorial
----
